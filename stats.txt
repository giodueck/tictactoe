Stats across 100 games of every matchup

## TLDR
Novice was only good against itself, since it is random, 
and could not compete against any other ai.

Intermediate smashed Novice, even as P2, and had an
advantage against itself as P1, since making a mistake on the
first move as P2 can guarantee a loss, which is why that 
advantage is gone against Experienced.

Experienced dominated Novice, and had a significant advantage
over Intermediate, but against itself it almost always tied,
and as P2 was able to force ties often.

Expert was expected to play lossless, and it did. But because it
also favored wins, it was able to completely dominate against Novice,
winning all games as P1 and most as P2. Experienced was able to play
cat, both as P1 and as P2, and Expert against itself was also 100% ties.
